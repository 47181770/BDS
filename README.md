Code and examples from Business Data Science.  The raw data and R scripts are in the `examples` directory.  

You can also use the issues on this repository to report any typos or errors in the book or just to ask or answer questions about the material (and thanks for doing so!!).  Please also feel encouraged to fork the repository, improve the examples, and submit pull requests.  We can all work together to make the material easier to understand (and remove errors).

For those using this book for teaching, my old course materials from Chicago Booth are at https://github.com/TaddyLab/MBAcourse.
